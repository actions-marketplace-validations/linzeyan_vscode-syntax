// Differential highlight check: the same fixture, tokenized twice -- once by the
// grammar poly ships and once by the grammar of the extension poly took it over
// from -- asserting poly never colours *less* than the thing it replaced.
//
// tokenize-check.mjs asks "did this grammar engage at all", which stays green
// when a takeover silently drops a scope the built-in had. The only way to see
// that is to run both and compare, which is what D5 promised: taking a built-in
// over swaps the grammar's source, not its output.
//
// What fails is decided in two steps, because poly pins its own upstream sha
// and deliberately runs ahead of whatever VSCode shipped:
//
//   - the grammar file itself is identical to the built-in's -- then the two
//     have to tokenize the same, and any scope only the built-in produced is
//     poly's packaging changing the answer (an injection reaching a language
//     nobody meant it to reach, a lost embeddedLanguages map). That fails.
//   - the grammar file differs -- upstream moved, and a re-scoped token is what
//     an upstream improvement looks like. Reported as drift for review.
//
// Extra scopes are never a failure: adding mermaid inside a markdown fence is
// the point of an injection.

// compared by nobody. Saying which ones those are is the difference between
// "checked" and "not known to be broken".
//
// Not a failure, and split in two because only one half is a gap somebody could
// close. `markdown-math` and `cpp_embedded_latex` have no file association at
// all -- they exist to be embedded in another grammar, and no file name reaches
// them -- so they are named as out of reach rather than as untested. The
// associations are read off the built-in side because that is where they are
// declared: poly contributes the grammar for these ids and nothing else.
