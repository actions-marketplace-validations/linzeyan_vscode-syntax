// What the shipped grammars do with input nobody would write on purpose.
//
// The fixture check asks whether a grammar engages on a well-formed sample.
// This asks the other question: a grammar is a pile of backtracking regexes run
// by oniguruma on every keystroke, and the inputs that make one of them take a
// second are not the ones anyone writes deliberately -- they are half-typed
// strings, a pasted minified line, a run of brackets, a file that opens a block
// comment and never closes it.
//
// The pass/fail line is the editor's own, twice over:
//
//   * VSCode tokenizes with a time limit, and a line past it is not a slow
//     editor but a wrong one -- `stoppedEarly` comes back true and everything
//     after the last token is painted as plain text. No invented budget.
//   * Every grammar here was synced from somewhere, and most of them from the
//     editor's own. So a slow grammar is only poly's problem when the built-in
//     of the same name is not slow: the same inputs go through both, and a
//     finding on both sides is upstream's behaviour, reported and not failed.
//
