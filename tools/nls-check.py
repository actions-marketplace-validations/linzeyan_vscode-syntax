"""Do the three manifests and their translations still agree?

`make nls`, and part of `make gates`.

VSCode resolves `%key%` against package.nls.json, and against
package.nls.<locale>.json when the editor is in that locale. Neither failure
mode is loud: a `%key%` with no entry renders as the literal `%key%` in the
settings UI, and a key missing from the Chinese file silently falls back to
English. Both look like nothing happened, so both need a check rather than a
reviewer.

Three things are asserted, per extension:

  * every `%key%` the manifest references exists in package.nls.json
  * package.nls.json has no key the manifest never references
  * every locale file holds exactly the same key set as the English one

The second one matters as much as the first. A key left behind after a setting
is removed is a translation somebody will keep updating for a string nobody
renders.
