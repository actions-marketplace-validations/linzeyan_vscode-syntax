// The .proto half: does poly reach the Go that protoc generated for it?
//
// `linkGeneratedGo` is four steps -- compose a Go name out of a proto symbol,
// find the generated file by that file's name, find the name inside it, then
// ask that symbol's server who implements it -- and the unit tests cover the
// first step only, because the other three are questions for an editor. Both
// defects this feature shipped with were in the part no unit test can reach:
// `no impls` over every rpc, and `no interfaces` over every class. Both were
// visible in the first minute of running in a host.
//
// The servers here are fixtures, and that is the limit of what this proves. It
// proves poly's wiring -- name -> file -> symbol -> implementation query ->
// label -- against providers shaped like what `buf lsp serve` and gopls were
// measured to return (tools/lens-probe.py). It does not prove buf and gopls
// still answer that way; `make lens-probe` is what says that, and it is an
// audit rather than a gate because it needs both servers installed.
